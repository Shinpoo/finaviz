# Finaviz

Finaviz is a web UI to track dividend stock data. Data comes from [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance) and stored in databases.

The website is OFF as I couldn't maintain databases for a long time since the amount of data is huge. Made this project mainly to learn about django framework in depth.
